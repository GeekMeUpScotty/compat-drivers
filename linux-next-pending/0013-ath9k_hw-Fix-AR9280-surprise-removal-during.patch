Bit 22 of AR_WA should be set to fix the situation where chip reset
is asynchronous to clock of analog shift registers, such that when
reset is released, it could mess up the values of analog shift registers
and cause some hw issue on AR9280.

This bit is write only, but the driver does a read-modify-write
on AR_WA without setting bit 22 in ar9002_hw_configpcipowersave()
during radio disable. This causes surprise removal of hw. It can
never recover from this state and the hw will become usable only
after a power on/off cycle, and sometimes only during a cold reboot.

This issue can be triggered by doing frequent roaming with the
simple/test-roam script available from the wifi-test project [1]
when roaming between APs quickly. When roaming there is a is a high
possibility that the device being put into idle (radio disable) state
by mac80211 during AUTH->ASSOC. A device hardware reset would fail
and the kernel would output:

This is currently only reproducible with some HB92 (Half Mini-PCIE)
cards but the fix applies to all AR9280 cards. This patch fixes this
issue by setting bit 22 during radio disable.

This patch has fixes for all kernels that has ath9k.
