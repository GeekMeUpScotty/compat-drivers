Linux Wireless compatibility package
=====================================

Compat-wireless was designed to allow you to install the latest
bleeding edge Linux wireless drivers on older kernels. Sometimes you
don't want to run bleeding edge wireless and but compat-wireless gives
you no other option, that's where the compat-wireless stable snapshots
come in.

compat-wireless stable snapshots
================================

This package allows you install the 2.6.30 Linux wireless
drivers on kernels >= 2.6.27.

Install
======

make
sudo make install
sudo make unload

Loading
=======

To load just modprobe the module you want or reboot. To
verify you are picking up the new modules you can use
modprobe -l. The new modules will come from the updates/
directory instead of the kernel/ directory. For example to
test if ath9k is being picked up correctly you would run:

$ for i in cfg80211 mac80211 ath9k; do modprobe -l $i; done
/lib/modules/2.6.27-11-generic/updates/net/wireless/cfg80211.ko
/lib/modules/2.6.27-11-generic/updates/net/mac80211/mac80211.ko
/lib/modules/2.6.27-11-generic/updates/drivers/net/wireless/ath9k/ath9k.ko

Note that the make install command will output this for you so you
can just look at that.
